"Hey! Are you all right?"
PROMPT
"Looks like you had a rough fall. 
You're stuff is all scattered on the ground."
PROMPT
"Well you should have a half hour before the guards make their rounds.
Just grab painting and run back here."
PROMPT
"What?! You're asking me which one right now?"
"It's the painting with Mary and Jesus. The Raphael one."
PROMPT
"Probably going to want to find your flashlight first."
"Oh, and don't forget the paintings are bolted down."
PROMPT
"Yeah, I don't need your sass about how unprepared we are for this heist.
Not my problem. 
I'm not lifting you out of there until you come back with the painting."
PROMPT
Looks like I'm on my own.
